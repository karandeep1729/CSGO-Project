🕹️ CSGO Match Outcome Prediction
📌 Overview
This project explores a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO) dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and applies multiple Machine Learning models to predict match outcomes.
The goal is to understand player/game patterns and evaluate model performance across different algorithms.

⚙️ Techniques & Models
🔍 EDA – Analyzed player statistics and match-level patterns

📊 Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) – Dimensionality reduction + classification

🔗 Logistic Regression – Baseline predictive model

🌳 Decision Tree Classifier – Simple interpretable model

🌲 Random Forest Classifier – Ensemble model for better accuracy

🚀 Results
Compared the performance of multiple ML models

Identified key features influencing predictions

Random Forest achieved the best balance between accuracy and interpretability

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy (data handling)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

Scikit-learn (ML models)
