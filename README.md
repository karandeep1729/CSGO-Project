 CSGO Match Outcome Prediction

Goal: To understand player/game patterns and evaluate model performance across different algorithms.

Techniques & Models
EDA – Analyzed player statistics and match-level patterns

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) – Dimensionality reduction + classification

Logistic Regression – Baseline predictive model

Decision Tree Classifier – Simple interpretable model

Random Forest Classifier – Ensemble model for better accuracy

Results
Compared the performance of multiple ML models

Identified key features influencing predictions

Random Forest achieved the best balance between accuracy and interpretability

Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy (data handling)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

Scikit-learn (ML models)
